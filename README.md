# kinematics-simulations
MATLAB simulation codes for popular mechanisms kinematics analysis
- fourbar.m : Four Bar Linkage Mechanism
- fourbarcoupler.m : Four Bar Linkage with a rigid link (offset) mounted on the coupler
- slidercrank.m : Popular slider crank mechanism used in reciprocating engines
- pantograph.m : A mechanical linkage connected in a manner based on parallelograms so that the movement of one pen, in tracing an image, produces identical movements in a second pen
- mech_gripper.m : Mechanical gripper mechanism used in simple robots for gripping action
- watt_6bar.m : Watt's six bar linkage is essentially two four bar linkages in series with constant angular relationship between links 4 and 5
